# covid19
Forecast of the developments of the COVID19 in Portugal using the data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

In order to run the code in the notebook you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine and then:

1) Install the packages as `pip install requirements.txt`
2) Run the script to get the data as `python get_data.py`
3) You are then able to run the notebook with the most up to date data. The generated plots will be saved under the folder data. 

If you pretend to cooperate, please change the colab notebook an open a Pull Request.
