# covid19
Forecast of the developments of the COVID19 in Portugal using the data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

There are two options for running the code. You can run the code in Google Colab (without installing anything):
http://bit.ly/2U6ATxF

Or you can clone this repository. In order to run the code in the notebook `covid-19-colab.ipynb` you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine and then:

1) Install the packages as `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Run the script to get the data as `python get_data.py`
3) You are then able to run the notebook covid-19-colab.ipynb with the most up to date data. The generated plots will be saved under the folder data. 

If you pretend to cooperate, please only change the colab notebook an open a Pull Request.
